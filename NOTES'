*   FIFO buffer on queued packets to write
    Must maintain position of written bytes, incase not all,
    bytes are written on first attempt. Dont free packet if,
    all data has not been written yet.

*   Or performance, FIFO is probably best implemented as a linked,
    list queue.

*   Still not totally sure how the channel IO works

*   Maybe implement a generic ssh packet struct instead,
    of a low level generic buffer as Dropbear does it.
