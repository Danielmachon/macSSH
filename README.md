# SSH v2 Client/Server implementation

SSH is a lightweight client/server implementation of the SSH v2 protocol, written entirely in C. SSH has no external or dynamic dependencies and links statically against bundled tomcrypt and tommath at compile time.

DMA-SSH follows the Linux kernel coding style (see CODING_STYLE)
