*	FIFO buffer on queued packets to write
	Must maintain position of written bytes, incase not all,
	bytes are written on first attempt. Dont free packet if,
	all data has not been written yet.

*	Or performance, FIFO is probably best implemented as a linked,
	list queue.

*	Still not totally sure how the channel IO works

*	Maybe implement a generic ssh packet struct instead,
	of a low level generic buffer as Dropbear does it.

*	Using temporary packet to store partial packets,
	that have not been fully read from the socket tcp,
	buffer

*	Identification read is done in blocking mode with a,
	timeout.

*       It is RECOMMENDED that the keys be changed after each gigabyte of
        transmitted data or after each hour of connection time, whichever
        comes sooner.  However, since the re-exchange is a public key
        operation, it requires a fair amount of processing power and should
        not be performed too often.
        Key re-exchange uses the same cipher, mac etc. as before te reexchange.
        Only after SSH_MSG_NEWKEYS is sent will the new values be taken in use.
